## How to Use This Guide

### For Testing

1. **Build and flash** the example to your Daisy Seed.
2. **Observe behavior** against the "Expected Behavior" column.

### Reporting Issues

If you find a discrepancy:

1. Check the "Common Issues" column first.
2. Verify your hardware setup matches requirements.
3. If still failing, open a GitHub issue with:
   - Example name.
   - Expected vs actual behavior.
   - Hardware setup.
   - Test results from working examples.

## Quick Start

### Building Examples

To build an example, you should have Nimphea installed via Nimble:

```bash
nimble install nimphea
```

Then navigate to an example directory and use its local tasks:

```bash
cd examples/blink
nimble make
nimble flash   # Via USB DFU
# OR
nimble stlink  # Via ST-Link probe
```

### Entering DFU Mode

1. Hold BOOT button on Daisy Seed.
2. Press and release RESET button.
3. Release BOOT button.
4. LED should be off (DFU mode active).
5. Run `nimble flash`.

## Common Patterns

### Standard Initialization

All examples follow this pattern:

```nim
import nimphea

useNimpheaNamespace()  # Macro for C++ includes

var hw: DaisySeed  # Global hardware object

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()  # Initialize hardware
  
  # Your setup code here
  
  while true:
    # Main loop
    hw.delay(100)

when isMainModule:
  main()
```

### Audio Callback Structure

```nim
proc audioCallback(input, output: AudioBuffer, size: int) {.cdecl.} =
  ## Real-time audio processing
  ## RULES:
  ## - No allocations (no seq, no string)
  ## - No printing/logging
  ## - No delays or blocking calls
  ## - Keep processing fast and deterministic
  
  for i in 0..<size:
    # Process left channel
    output[0][i] = input[0][i]
    # Process right channel
    output[1][i] = input[1][i]

proc main() =
  hw = initDaisy()
  hw.startAudio(audioCallback)  # Register callback
  
  while true:
    # Main loop runs independently from audio
    hw.delay(10)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Compilation Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Error: cannot open file 'nimphea.nim'` | Wrong directory | Import from correct path or install via nimble |
| `undefined reference to daisy::DaisySeed` | libDaisy not built | `cd libDaisy && make` |
| `arm-none-eabi-gcc: command not found` | Toolchain not installed | Install ARM embedded toolchain |
| `Error: undeclared identifier` | Missing import | Add required `import nimphea/module` |

### Runtime Issues

#### No LED Activity

1. Check hardware initialization: `hw.init()`
2. Try `blink.nim` (simplest example)
3. Verify power supply (USB or external 3.3-5V)
4. Check for panic crash (LED might blink SOS pattern)

#### No Audio Output

1. Verify audio callback registered: `hw.startAudio(callback)`
2. Check audio cable connections (input and output)
3. Test with `audio_demo.nim` SINE_WAVE mode (doesn't need input)
4. Verify sample rate matches hardware (48kHz default)
5. Check volume level on amp/headphones
